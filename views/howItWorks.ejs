                        <p>Design your part using CAD</p>
                        <p>Determine the purpose and specifications of the part. Before you start designing, it's important to understand what the part is for and what its specific requirements are. This might include dimensions, materials, strength requirements, and any other functional or aesthetic considerations.</p>
                        <p>Choose a CAD software. There are many different CAD programs available, ranging from simple 2D drafting tools to more advanced 3D modeling software. Choose a program that meets your needs and that you feel comfortable using.</p>
                        <p>Save and export the file. When you're happy with your design, save the file in a format that can be used by your 3D printer or other manufacturing equipment. Common file formats for 3D printing include STL and OBJ, but you may need to use a different format depending on your specific needs.</p>

                        <p>Check for accuracy: One of the most important aspects of checking a CAD design is ensuring that it is accurate. This includes checking the dimensions and measurements of the design to make sure they are correct and that all parts fit together as intended. You should also check that the design is properly aligned and that all lines and curves are smooth and continuous.</p>
                        <p>Check for functionality: In addition to accuracy, it's important to make sure that the design functions as intended. This may involve testing the design using simulation software or by physically prototyping the design to see how it performs.</p>
