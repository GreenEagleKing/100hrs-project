# Fabpad Community Marketplace

FabPad is the go to 3D print and fabrication marketplace for creators and engineers to find hard to find parts. I wanted to create a place for users to share bespoke parts they have engineered and created. Through uploading 3D models and instructional plans, other users could download and build them.

It is currently at a MVP level with the core functionality built into it.

\*\*It is not been optimised for a responsive layout for mobile yet.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDB, NodeJS Express

This website is a fullstack application that has been fully designed and built by myself. The backend database is hosted on MongoDB and uses NodeJS to route the pages and Express to make things easier. The data from the database is injected onto pages through the use of EJS with Javascript helping with particuar funcitonality on the website. I wanted to use Tailwind to create more consistent styling throughout the website.

Added extras:

- I used cloundinary to host the 3D models and viewer
- Passport is used for user authentication

# The Future:

- Option to upload mulitple files including 3D, images and plans.
- Search and sort the library for particular results
- Add comments to products
- Optimise for mobile usage

# Lessons Learned:

- How to route to pages and what controller is required.
- Using Tailwind CSS
- User authentication and subsequent access to certain areas of the website.
